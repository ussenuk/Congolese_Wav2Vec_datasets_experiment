# Congolese_Wav2Vec

Cdwav2vec is a multilingual speech model that has been trained using 4 Congolese languages. This model reflects the broadest variety of Congolese languages within the pool of multilingual speech models.  We fine-tuned this model for downsteam ASR for 2 languages and obtain benchmark results on 2 public benchmarks, namely Congolese Swahili (Gamayun audio mini-kit) and the Lingala Read Speech Corpus.

As part of Cdwav2vec, we are creating the biggest corpora accessible to the public for 4 languages belonging to the Niger-Congo B language family.. We also trained state-of-the-art ASR models for 2 congolese languages.
